                    <p class="pl-15">Ask yourself what you want to achieve with your pricing, and then establish a pricing plan that will help you reach your goals.

                    <p class="pl-15">Calculate what proportion of your fixed costs the product should cover. To generate a unit break-even value, add all of these costs together and divide by volume. To your break-even point, you'll need to add a margin or mark-up. Typically, this is represented as a percentage of break-even. The level of mark-up will be determined by industry norms, experience, and market understanding. If the price appears to be excessively high, cut your costs and the pricing correspondingly.</p>
